The SAML Enhanced Client or Proxy Profile (ECP) is a SAML
authentication method designed for non-browser non-interactive SAML
auththentication. It is commonly used by command line tools to
authenticate via SAML.

ECP is often misunderstood and example implementations are hard to
find. ecp_demo is a Python3 implementation of ECP designed both to
educate implementors about ECP and perform a complete ECP
authentication flow with the ability to dump all protocol interactions
for the purpose of education and/or diagnosing ECP transactions.

All documenation can be found in the ecp_demo script.

An example of the ecp_demo output can be found in ecp_demo.log
