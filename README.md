# Introduction

The SAML Enhanced Client or Proxy Profile (ECP) is a SAML
authentication method designed for non-browser non-interactive SAML
auththentication. It is commonly used by command line tools to
authenticate via SAML.

ECP is often misunderstood and example implementations are hard to
find. saml_ecp_demo is a Python3 implementation of ECP designed both to
educate implementors about ECP and perform a complete ECP
authentication flow with the ability to dump all protocol interactions
for the purpose of education and/or diagnosing ECP transactions.

All documenation can be found in the saml_ecp_demo.py. The script also
supports the --help command line argument and will print out usage
information.

```shell
% saml_ecp_demo --help
```

An example of the saml_ecp_demo output can be found in saml_ecp_demo.log

## Installing and Running:

You can run the script from a checkout of the Github repo

```shell
% cd saml_ecp_demo
% python3 saml_ecp_demo.py
# Or make it executable and run it directly
% chmod +x saml_ecp_demo.py
% ./saml_ecp_demo.py
```

-OR-

saml_ecp_demo is also available as a Python PI package and can be
installed via Python pip.

```shell
% pip3 install --user saml_ecp_demo
```

This will create an entry in the appropriate bin directory called
"saml_ecp_demo" which can then be run by typing that name on the
command line.

```shell
% saml_ecp_demo ...
```

> **Note:** The --user tells pip to install in the user's home directory not
> in the system directories which are often managed by the operating
> system package manager and would require root access for
> installation. It's also advisable to have pip avoid using the system
> locations because it can corrupt files maintained by the system
> package manager. When you use --user you'll find the installed files
> under ~/.local

> **Important:** saml_ecp_demo is written for Python3, it does not support
> Python2, make sure you're using the Python3 version of pip otherwise
> the generated console script will invoke the wrong Python interpreter.

> **Note:** This installs a Python package called saml_ecp_demo under
> $PY_INSTALL_LOCATION/site-packages/saml_ecp_demo. The actual source
> code is in
> $PY_INSTALL_LOCATION/site-packages/saml_ecp_demo/saml_ecp_demo.py. The
> Python pip installer creates a console script called saml_ecp_demo in
> the appropriate bin directory that simply loads the actual script from
> the package directory. Python uses this redirection for scripts
> because running scripts is operating system specific but Python code
> is portable.
